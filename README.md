# Diver

Diver is experimental spider for site mapping.

Diver can analysis the link url on a website, and then draw a url tree on the screen, so users can find the target they want faster.

Diver also has a Web UI build with Flask framework, for better user experience.

I am working on it to provide a better user experience and better search results. It will be so good if you give me any advice or feedback.

Star, issues, and pull requests are all welcomed.
