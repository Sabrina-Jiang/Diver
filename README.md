Diver is experimental spider for site mapping.

Diver can analysis the link url on a website, and then draw a url tree on the screen, so users can find the target they want faster.

Diver also has a Web UI build with Flask framework, for better user experience.

# Usage

Diver is build with Python 3, you need to install Python 3 and some dependence at first.

```bash
pip3 install graphviz PyQuery Flask
export FLASK_APP="server.py"
flask run
```  

Tested under Ubuntu 16.04, macOS 10.12, Mac OS X 10.11.

# Future

I am working on it to provide a better user experience and better search results. It will be so good if you give me any advice or feedback.
